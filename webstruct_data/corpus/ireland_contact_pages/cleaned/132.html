            <p><strong>The Independent Pizza Company</strong> opened in the summer of 1984 and recently celebrated 25 years in business in Drumcondra. In 2002 we moved a few doors down the road to a bigger custom built location from where we now operate.</p>

<p>The Independent Pizza Company is a casual neighbourhood pizza restaurant where you can relax, chill out and enjoy yourself without feeling too worried about the size of the bill at the end! 
Our concept is to deliver top quality Pizza, at reasonable prices, in an unpretentious and casual setting. Our Pizza style is American – light crisp bases with traditional &amp; contemporary topping combinations that suit all tastes.</p>
<p>Most of our menu and, of course, all of our signature pizzas, utilise our stone pizza oven which was imported for us from Washington State in the USA. These pizza ovens are regarded as the best in the world and we believe help us create outstanding pizza bases. 
Our pizza dough is freshly made every day, on the premises, using just five ingredients: flour, water, yeast and small amounts of salt and sugar. </p>
<p>All ingredients are bought in fresh &amp; prepared in our kitchen unlike other competitors who import frozen ingredients. </p>
<p>We buy the best produce available and we have excellent relationships with our suppliers- some of whom we have been dealing with for 25 years. Our baked ham for pizzas is from Cork, our pepperoni is made in Dundalk, <strong>Hicks</strong> in Dun Laoghaire supply sausages and our chicken wings are from <strong>Kettle Foods</strong> in Fermanagh. All our vegetables are delivered daily from local suppliers and our Irish &amp; European cheeses come from <strong>Glenealy Foods</strong> in Dublin.</p>
<p>We also provide a great take away service and pizza take &amp; bake service where you can order your pizza par-cooked ready to finish off in your oven when required. We operate a 10% loyalty discount for take-away pizzas where the 10th pizza purchased on your loyalty card is free!</p>
