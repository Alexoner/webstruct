About Galway

Galway, otherwise known as the City of the Tribes is a vibrant city and is always full of life all year round! Between holding one of the biggest race meetings - The Galway Races, to hosting The Oyster Festival each September to holding some of the biggest rugby matches in the Connaught Sports Grounds there is always something to do in Galway.

Apart from the high street entertainment it is home to thousands of students with the majority attending the National University of Ireland, Galway or the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology which both lie
O
in the heart of Galway.
