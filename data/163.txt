The 'Bridgestone Irish Food Guide' by John & Sally McKenna
O
Ananda was one of the most eagerly awaited restaurant openings of 2008. And with good cause: this partnership between Asheesh Dewan, owner of the outstanding Jaipur restaurants, and Atul Kochhar, the first Indian chef to receive a Michelin star for his renowned London restaurant Benares, promised a new benchmark for Indian food in Ireland and - that promise seems to have been fulfilled with éclat.

Lucinda O'Sullivan's Ireland Award

"Each year there are a few key restaurant openings that are awaited with anticipation, and Ananda at Dundrum Town Centre was one of these. Why would an opening at Dundrum Town Centre fall within this category, I can hear you say, after all its not exactly D2 which Richard Corrigan chose for his Dublin flagship."

Ananda's executive chef is Sunil Ghai, who has been working in the Jaipur restaurants for eight years, and is known for an impressive understanding of Indian cooking and remarkable finesse with spicing; prior to Ananda’s opening, Sunil spent several months working in Benares, and, together with Atul, has developed a highly innovative and contemporary menu.
