DUNNE Deal…
O
Ever conscious to keep an eye on your wallets & bank balances, Oliver and Graham have put together a super ‘Neighbourhood Menu’ sitting alongside the regular a la carte menu in La Brasserie.
O
Enjoy a  2 course meal and a glass of vino for only €24.95 .
O
The menu is available Tuesday-Thursday and is the perfect choice if you are tired of cooking, have an empty fridge, need a midweek treat, for a casual catchup or for whatever excuse you can come up with!
O
Do come try it out….

Whether you’re a foodie on a budget, or need to overcome the midweek slump, Bon Appetit is offering a whopping 25% off your food bill when you dine in our award winning Michelin Star Restaurant every Wednesday and Thursday evening .
O
The offer applies to our A La Carte Menu, Surprise Tasting Menu, and Menu Prestige (but excludes the early bird).
O
Go on, you know you’re tempted!
O
It’s Roasting!
O
It’s time to get the family together and spend Sunday’s the traditional way.
O
During our ‘Sunday Service’ in La Brasserie (from 12:30-8pm) you can dine on our ‘Roast of the Week’ served with all the trimmings - perfect for group dining with family and friends.
O
Some of the delicious Roasts on offer include Leg of Lamb; Corn-Fed Chicken; Roast Rib of Angus Beef; and Stuffed Saddle Back Pork.
O
Tempting heh?

Masterclasses with Oliver Dunne
O
Don’t be scared off by the title. Oliver’s masterclasses are a hit with the masses.
O
There are a bag load of exciting topics and from only €40.00 a class  - there is something to suit all tastes and budgets.
O
Our classes take a recess for the Summer months, but we’ve launched our Autumn / Winter class schedule commencing September due to high demand so check out the Masterclass page of the website for the full low-down & bag yourself a seat before everyone else does.
