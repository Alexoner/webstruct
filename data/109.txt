Broadway Pizza Parlor 4.5 star review: Friendly staff, lovely atmosphere, love the New York Broadway theme with the Playbills on the walls. Really good value for money. Pizzas are gorgeous and the penne arribiatta is one of my favourites. Good place to pop into if in the area. Definitely worth a go.

Broadway Pizza Parlor 5.0 star review: Have been meaning to write this for ages. Food here consistently good and I go there regularly. Always look forward to tasty and reasonably priced food. Attentive service. Need to book Thursday and Friday lunchtimes or else go earlier or later on another day.

Broadway Pizza Parlor 4.0 star review: This place is perfect to grab a quick bite for lunch. Have eaten here a number of times. Pizzas are fabulous. Portions are on the large size so could be shared.
O
Tables are very close together so wouldn't recommend this for a private tete a tete ! Other than that it's good value for money and the staff are very nice. Would recommend pizzas and the BLTs. Always have a special board too that appears to change regularly

Broadway Pizza Parlor 2.0 star review: My partner and I visited here for lunch yesterday. We were very disappointed with the service. It was a nightmare trying to get the attention of one of the various waitresses who seemed to be experts at avoiding eye contact. When we eventually ordered we asked for two Philly sandwich specials these consisted of sliced steak, peppers, onions and cheese. Apparently, I say apparently as we ended up having to cancel the order to get back to work as we were so long waiting for our invisible food to arrive. I would have assumed that particularly as this was a daily special they would have the steak etc cooked and ready to pop onto the bread so how 20 mins after our 10 min wait to order they still hadn't materialized is a bit of a mystery. While the restaurant was very busy this is no excuse as the table of 4 men beside us who arrived after we did and had their order taken before us had their food well before we eventually left. The waitress didn't even say sorry when we said we would have to leave just "oh right" therefore despite the food looking good we will not be going back purely due to the terrible service we received.

Broadway Pizza Parlor 5.0 star review: I have been twice to this restaurant after work and both times the food has been lovely.  It reminds me of the local small family restaurants in the suburbs of New York where I used to live and the atmosphere is lovely.  The food came quickly - we had a deal coupon for a 12" pizza, 2 sides and 2 glasses of wine.  The pizza was tasty and freshly baked and the sides were very generous portions - a full size house salad and 2 slices of garlic bread.  We continued with a couple more glasses of wine and dessert of tiramasu, which was a large portion with 2 small scoops of ice cream (one vanilla and one chocolate) and it was so tasty.  This is now on my list of favourite restaurants and I think it would be a great place to go for dinner before a concert in the Point/O2 as its practically at the NCI/Mayor Square Luas stop.

Broadway Pizza Parlor 4.5 star review: This is a great little spot for anyone working in the IFSC!  I popped in for lunch yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was efficient and friendly, and the food came nice and quickly so it was feasible to come here on an hour's lunch break.  The place was buzzing with lunchtime diners and there was good, old style music in the background adding to the atmosphere, I think it was Frank Sinatra and Michael Buble when I was there.
O
As for the food, make sure you go hungry! The portions were plentiful but tasty at the same time. Myself and my friend's had a range of different things... pizzas, salads and sandwiches, and everyone was happy! Make sure to keep an eye on the specials board. We were spoiled for choice.
O
I'll definitely be popping in here again for a lunchtime treat!

Broadway Pizza Parlor 5.0 star review: I work in the area and have been going to broadway for 2 years, it's a dependable, pocket friendly, new york style pizza parlour with the best service team I have come across in dublin! I rate this restaurant very highly. It's a real favourite of mine!
O
Today I had a Ham and Mozzarella calzone EUR8.00 and added mushroom EUR0.50 to it (well worth it for added flavour, very nice mushrooms!) and a diet coke EUR1.00. Total cost only EUR9.50!
O
Great place for a chat with your friends and always has a fast service time! And serves peroni beer (bonus!).
O
Will be back next week guys! See ya then!

Broadway Pizza Parlor 4.0 star review: I go here for lunch quite often - you will get a mix of college students and IFSC workers. Great lunch specials each day and they are good value for money. The service is fast and friendly. The chips are the skinniest in Dublin but somehow are still very delicious!
O
Great place for lunch - not sure about dinner.
O
They also do good pizza slice offers if you are in a rush - fresh from a stoneoven

Broadway Pizza Parlor 4.0 star review: Ate here mid afternoon and there was only 2 other people eating.  If I hadn't eaten here before I probably wouldn't have entered.  I love the decor in this restaurant and the food is excellent value and very tasty.  We both ordered from the specials board and thoroughly enjoyed our food.  I have had the pizza previously for lunch which I would recommend too. Staff are very friendly.

Lamb Cutlets with Garlic, Lemon and Paprika
O
Why not make up a large quantity of this marinade in advance - it is wonderful with cutlets and would also work well with leg steaks or loin chops.  The longer you marinate the meat for, the better the flavour!
