when the person rang they said they were outside a certain shop which is not outside my house so i told the delivery man that he was a bit away from where i live. he said in a harsh manner ´´this is always where i deliver´´ so even though it was only 200 metres away I feel that if you are having food delivered it should be to where you want it and not where it suits the lazy delivery man! all round rude manner of this man also
