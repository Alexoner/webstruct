Welcome to Bates Restaurant
O
"Where excellence is a tradition"
O
Bates Inn opened in 1785 and since then, through various incarnations, Bates has warmly welcomed guests and diners through it’s low, wide front door.
O
As an inn, a restaurant, a meeting place and an important part of the community of Rathdrum, Bates has maintained standards of excellence that are now a tradition.
O
Today, the award-winning Bates Restaurant is still building on that tradition: Sumptuous food meticulously prepared to imaginative menus, a wonderful atmosphere in the old, stone-built dining room and a loyal and enthusiastic clientele. We’re not standing still either, with constantly evolving menus, décor and art so there’s always something new to see and taste.
O
This is why people love Bates Restaurant. Why people come from miles around. Why so many make Bates a highlight of their visit to Glendalough, Powerscourt, Avondale, Laragh and the Wicklow Gap.
O
And this is why you should book your table now on 0404 29988

"One of the very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating."
