DIRECTIONS
O
If you have a Sat Nav, then type   in Rosemount Village, County Westmeath and it should bring you direct, though a   number of people with Sat Navs have had a bit of difficulty as the software does   not recognize the M6 motorway even though it’s been open for a few years! You   could also type in Moate, County Westmeath and follow a section of the   instructions below. Anyhow, the following should get you to us:
