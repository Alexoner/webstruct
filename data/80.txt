Hi fellas. If you wanna have mouth melting burger or the tastiest meal of your life order from this takeaway, I don´t know how to describe my impression, but it is way more than positive. I used to order from many takeaways over 5 years living in Ireland including Chinese takeaway (witch i´ve loved) and burger king, even domino´s pizza (witch i work for). For only 17 euro(including delivery charge) I´ve received the best tasting quarter pounder  ever, very tasty doner kebab meal with chips and extra sauce, and 4 cones of ice cream. Try it, you won´t be disappointed.
