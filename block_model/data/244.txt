Welcome to Matt the Thresher and our Seafood Bar & Grill, voted 'Best Seafood Restaurant' 2012
O
Matt the Thresher is a bright stylish city centre bar located in the heart of Georgian Dublin, just off Baggot Street near St. Stephens Green (Formerly the Pembroke Pub).
O
We specialise in fresh Irish seafood which we source directly from the harbours around the island. But we also sell the most tender of beef which we bring from our famous Inn and Restaurant in County Tipperary. The kitchen is led by well known chef and seafood connoisseur Stephen Caviston who has a life time of experience in all aspects of the seafood industry.
O
Our aim is to bring you simply cooked fresh fish, with a friendly service, in a beautiful city centre bar at a reasonable price.
