Welcome to the Southern Regional Drugs Task Force
O
"Working in partnership to reduce the harmful effects caused to society by Drug or alcohol misuse"
O
The Southern Regional Drugs Task Force was established under the National Drugs Strategy 2001 -2008 to work with communities who are experiencing issues of drug and alcohol misuse (in counties Cork & Kerry, but not Cork City, where there is a Local Drugs Task Force ), and to support projects in these communities which address an identified need.   The Task Force now operates under the National Drugs Strategy 2009 -2016
O
The Task Force operates using Partnership Principles and has membership from the statutory, voluntary and community sectors alongside public representatives. The SRDTF employs a coordinator (Chris Black) and a Development Worker (Gordon Kinsley) who are employed to oversee the implementation of a Regional Strategy.  The Coordinator is employed by the HSE but reports to the Chairperson of the Task Force (Tom Daly) for day to day operations
