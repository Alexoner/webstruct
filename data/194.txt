ABOUT PAULIE'S PIZZA
O
In July 2010 we were delighted to open Paulie's Pizza. With Paulie's Pizza our aim is to be the first pizzeria in Ireland to create real Neapolitan style pizza.
O
To do this we use only Caputo '00' flour, San Marzano tomatoes, the best mozzarella, slow proved dough and a wood fired oven which cooks at over 450 degrees Celsius. The Vera Pizza Napoletana.

PAULIE'S PIZZA THE OVEN
O
The oven which is at the heart of the restaurant was imported in one piece from the manufacturer in Italy.
O
It is made in the traditional Neapolitan way with a low roof which allows the pizzaiolo to finish the pizza in the smoke at the top of the dome giving a unique charred taste not possible in conventional ovens.
