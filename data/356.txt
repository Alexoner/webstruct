La Boheme Restaurant - Waterford
O
People often ask us what La Boheme means. It’s quite simple really. Before settling in Waterford, we moved around a lot, living in different places. You could say our lifestyle was a little unusual, even bohemian. So when we eventually found this place and opened the restaurant, we wanted a name that reflected our personality and captured the essence of what we wanted to create; a taste of France in the heart of Waterford, where the moment you stepped through the door, you were transported to the continent.
O
And that’s what endeared us to the vaults of the Georgian building we chose to restore. Its flagstone floors, lime washed walls and arched ceilings reminded us of the great kitchens of the French chateaux, their old world charm and classic culinary ambience. It was meant to be a restaurant. It has the heart and soul of a kitchen with the warmth and character of a home.
