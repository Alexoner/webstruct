In 2007 he realised his dream of opening his own restaurant in Carlingford.  Using all Irish produce whenever possible, The Bay Tree has built up a deserving reputation amongst locals and holiday-makers alike.  In just 4 short years it has become one of the most talked about, exciting restaurants in the Louth area.

Our emphasis is on fresh local fish and simple modern food at great prices. We use only the best ingredients and produce all our breads, stocks, sauces, ice creams and sorbets ourselves. When in season we are self sufficient with organic herbs and lettuce.  In our    20 ft by 14 ft poly tunnel at the rear of the restaurant    we    grow micro leaves, unusual salad leaves   and   mustard leaves    .  All our top quality meat is supplied by Kettyle Irish Foods . No artificial colours or flavourings. Taste the difference!
O
In summer our restaurant is open seven days a week 6pm - late and for Sunday lunch.
O
In winter, it is closed Mondays and Tuesdays.
O
We can open outside of these times for group bookings.  Please contact us for details.
