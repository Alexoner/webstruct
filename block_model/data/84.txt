What's the story?
O
JUST EAT opened its virtual doors in 2001. The company was founded in Denmark by a group of friends with a serious case of the munchies.
O
Over the last decade, JUST EAT has gone on to become the undisputed king of European online takeaway, with local flavours in thirteen countries. We now have over 25,000 restaurants in our family bucket and operate across 4 continents.
O
Just-Eat.ie launched in May 2008, over a printers in Finglas. We started off with offices in O'Connell Street, right in the centre of Dublin and have recently moved to super cool new offices in Granby Place, Dublin 1.
