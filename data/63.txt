Information
O
If you rent out a room (or rooms) in your home to private tenants, the
O
rental income you earn will be exempt from income tax, provided this income
O
does not exceed €10,000 in a tax year. This is called the rent a room
O
relief .
O
Where more than one person is entitled to benefit from the rent (for
O
example, you and your spouse), the limit of €10,000 is divided between the
O
individuals concerned. Tenants who rent out a room in your home are entitled to claim
O
tax relief on rent paid .
O
In certain cases you will not be entitled to claim the relief. These
O
exclusions are listed under 'Rules' below.
O
Your rights and obligations as a landlord
O
If you choose to rent out a room in your home, you are not covered by
O
landlord/tenant legislation in Ireland. This means that you are not obliged to
O
register with the Private
O
Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) as a landlord, provide a rent book to the tenant or
O
ensure that the accommodation provided meets any minimum
O
physical standards .
O
This also means that private tenants living in your home are living under
O
a licensee agreement  not a tenancy agreement and
O
are really only entitled to reasonable notice if you choose to
O
terminate the agreement. Tenants are, however, entitled to refer disputes
O
regarding periods of reasonable notice, retention of deposits, and disputes
O
regarding deductions from rent for damage to property that is over and above
O
normal wear and tear to the Small Claims Court .
O
Before you agree or choose to rent out a room in your home, it is strongly recommended that you and the tenant agree some
O
ground-rules in advance. You should put these ground-rules in writing and both
O
parties (that is, you and your tenant) should sign and each keep a copy of this
O
agreement so you can both refer to the terms of your agreement in the event of
O
confusion or disagreement. Some of the ground-rules you might consider are:
O
What will the period of the tenancy be?
O
What will be the minimum periods of notice if either party chooses to
O
terminate the agreement?
O
How much will the rent be and when can this be reviewed?
O
How will rent be paid and is rent to be paid weekly/fortnightly/monthly?
O
What is the situation regarding visitors and friends staying over?
O
Are there any restrictions regarding noise levels?
O
Effect of rental income on social welfare payments
O
If you are getting a means-tested social
O
assistance payment from the Department of Social Protection, any rental
O
income you get will be assessed as means and may affect your payment. However,
O
rental income will not be assessed as means if you are getting a State
O
Pension (Non-Contributory) or Widow's/Widower's
O
or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension and you would be
O
living alone unless you rented out a room in your home.
O
Rules
O
To get rent a room relief:
O
The total (gross) rent you get from your tenant (or tenants), which
O
includes sums the tenant pays for food, utilities, laundry or similar goods
O
and services, cannot exceed €10,000. If you get rental income over and
O
above this amount, you are not entitled to the relief
O
Your home must be in Ireland and must be occupied by you during the year
O
of assessment as your principal private residence.
O
You cannot deduct expenses from your rental income to qualify for rent a
O
room relief. If you qualify for rent a room relief, the income you get from
O
renting a room in your home is not liable to PRSI, the Universal
O
Social Charge or income tax. However, it must be included on your
O
annual income tax return .
O
Rent a Room Relief will not affect your mortgage interest
O
relief or your exemption from Capital Gains
O
Tax (CGT) . (CGT is a tax on the capital gain (profit) made on the disposal
O
of an asset, for example, when you sell a house).
O
Exclusions from rent a room relief
O
You will not qualify for tax relief on the rental income if:
O
Your gross income from rent is over €10,000. In this case, your rental
O
income minus allowable expenses will be treated by Revenue as part of your
O
total income for tax purposes and should be included in your tax return.
O
You are renting the room in your home to your son or daughter.
O
You are an employee or office-holder in a company, and the company pays
O
you to allow clients to use the room in your home on an occasional basis.
O
Rates
O
Rental income from renting a room in your home is exempt from tax, up to a
O
maximum limit of €10,000.
O
How to apply
O
Complete a Tax Return Form 12
O
(pdf) at the end of the tax year indicating that you have received rental
O
income for rent a room relief. Form 12 is available from your local tax office.

O
office. Your local tax office can answer any queries you may have and will
O
assist if you have any difficulties completing your annual Tax Return.
